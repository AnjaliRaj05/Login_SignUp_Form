# MERN Login and Sign-Up Page

This repository contains code for a simple login and sign-up page built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project serves as a basic example of how to implement authentication functionalities in a web application using these technologies.

## Features
- User registration: Allows new users to sign up by providing their email and password.
- User authentication: Validates user credentials upon login.
- Password hashing: Securely stores hashed passwords in the database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure the MongoDB connection string. To do this:

1. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory.

2. Add your MongoDB connection string in the `.env` file:


Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection string.

## Usage

1. Start the server:


This will start the Node.js server on `http://localhost:9002`.

2. Start the client:

This will start the React development server on `http://localhost:9002`.

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.
